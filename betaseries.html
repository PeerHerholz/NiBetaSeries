<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Betaseries track the trial-to-trial modelled hemodynamic fluctuations
that occur within task functional magnetic resonance imaging (task fMRI).
This fills an important analytical gap between measuring hemodynamic
fluctuations in resting state fMRI and measuring regional activations
via cognitive subtraction in task fMRI.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="relationship-to-resting-state">
<h2>Relationship to Resting State<a class="headerlink" href="#relationship-to-resting-state" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Betaseries is similar to resting state because the same analytical strategies
applied to resting state data can ostensibly be applied to betaseries.
At the core of both resting state and betaseries we are working with
a list of numbers at each voxel.
We can correlate, estimate regional homogeneity, perform independent
components analysis, or conduct a number of different analyses
with these voxels.
However, betaseries deviates from resting state in two important ways.
First, you can do cognitive subtraction using betaseries.
Second, interpretation of the lists of numbers are different for
resting state and betaseries.
Resting state measures the unmodelled hemodynamic fluctuations that occur
without explicit stimuli.
Betaseries, on the other hand, measures the modelled hemodynamic fluctuations
that occur in response to an explicit stimulus.
Both resting state and betaseries may measure intrinsic connectivity,
but betaseries may also measure the task evoked connectivity
(e.g. connectivity between regions that is increased during some
cognitive process).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="relationship-to-traditional-task-analysis">
<h2>Relationship to Traditional Task Analysis<a class="headerlink" href="#relationship-to-traditional-task-analysis" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Betaseries is also similar to traditional task analysis because
cognitive subtraction can be used in both.
As with resting state, betaseries deviates from traditional task analysis
in several important ways.
Say we are interested in observing how the brain responds to faces
versus houses.
The experimenter has a timestamp of exactly when and how long
a face or house is presented.
That timestamp information is typically convolved with a hemodynamic
response function (HRF) to represent how the brain stereotypically responds to
any stimulus resulting in a model of how we expect the brain to respond
to places and/or faces.
This is where traditional task analysis and betaseries diverge.
In traditional task analysis all the face trials are estimated at once,
giving one summary measure for how strongly each voxel was activated
(same for house trials).
The experimenter can subtract the summary measure of faces from houses
to see which voxels are more responsive to houses relative to faces
(i.e. cognitive subtraction).
In betaseries each trial is estimated separately each voxel has as many
estimates at there are trials (which can be labelled as either
face or house trials).
The experimenter can now reduce the series of estimates (a betaseries)
for each voxel into a summary measure such as a correlation with
region(s) of interest.
The correlation map for faces can be subtracted from houses, giving
voxels that are more correlated with the region of interest for houses
relative to faces.
Whereas traditional task analysis treats the variance of brain responses
between trials of the same type (e.g. face or house) as noise,
betaseries leverages this variance to make conclusions about which brain
regions may communicate with each other during a particular trial type
(e.g. faces or houses).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="summary">
<h2>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Betaseries is not in opposition to resting state or traditional task analysis,
the methods are complementary.
For example, network parcelations derived from resting state data can be
used on betaseries data to ascertain if the networks observed in resting state
follow a similar pattern with betaseries.
Additionally, regions determined from traditional task analysis
can be used as regions of interest for betaseries analysis.
Betaseries straddles the line between traditional task analysis and
resting state, observing task data through a network lens.</p>

<h2>Conceptual Background<a class="headerlink" href="#conceptual-background" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Jesse Rissman <a class="reference internal" href="#rissman2004" id="id1">[Rissman2004]</a> was the first to publish on betaseries
correlations describing their usage in the context of a working memory task.
In this task, participants saw a cue, a delay, and a probe, all occurring
close in time.
A cue was presented for one second, a delay occurred for seven seconds,
and a probe was presented for one second.
Given the HRF takes approximately six seconds to reach its
peak, and generally takes over 20 seconds to completely resolve, we can
begin to see a problem.
The events within the trials occur too close to each other to discern what
brain responses are related to encoding the cue, the delay, or the probe.
To discern how the activated brain regions form networks, Rissman
conceptualized betaseries correlations.
Instead of having a single regressor to describe all the cue events,
a single regressor for all the delay events, and a single regressor for all the
probe events (as is done in traditional task analysis),
there is an individual regressor for every event in the experiment.
For example, if your experiment has 40 trials, each with a cue, delay, and
probe event, the model will have a total of 120 regressors, fitting a beta
estimate for each trial.
Complete this process for each trial of a given event type (e.g. cue), at
the end you will have <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">4D</span></code> volume where each volume represents the beta
estimates for a particular trial, and each voxel represents a specific
beta estimate.</p>
<p>Having one regressor per trial in a single model is known as least squares all.
This method, however, has limitations in the context of fast event related
designs.
Since each trial has its own regressor, trials that occur very close in time
are colinear (e.g. are very overlapping).
Jeanette Mumford et al. <a class="reference internal" href="#mumford2012" id="id2">[Mumford2012]</a> investigated this issue in the context
of image classification.
In this article, Mumford introduces another modelling strategy known as least
squares separate.
In this modelling strategy, instead of having one GLM with a regressor per
trial, least squares separate implements a GLM per trial with two regressors:
1) one for the trial of interest, and 2) one for every other trial in the
experiment.
This process reduces the colinearity of the regressors and creates a more valid
estimate of how each regressor fits the data.</p>

<div class="section" id="math-background">
<h2>Math Background<a class="headerlink" href="#math-background" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{equation}
     Y = X\beta + \epsilon
 \end{equation}\]</div>
<p>The above equation is the General Linear Model (GLM) presented using
matrix notation.
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Y\)</span> represents the time-series we are attempting to explain.
The <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta\)</span> assumes any value that minimizes the squared error between
the modeled data and the actual data, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Y\)</span>.
Finally, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\epsilon\)</span> (epsilon) refers to the error that is not captured
by the model.
Within a GLM, trial-to-trial betas may be averaged for a given trial type
and the variance is treated as noise.
However, those trial-to-trial fluctuations may also contain important
information the typical GLM will ignore/penalize.
With a couple modifications to the above equation, we arrive at calculating a
betaseries.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{equation}
    Y = X_1\beta_1 + X_2\beta_2 + . . . + X_n\beta_n + \epsilon
\end{equation}\]</div>
<p>With the betaseries equation, a beta is estimated for every trial, instead of
for each trial type (or whatever logical grouping).
This gives us the ability to align all the trial betas from a single trial
type into a list (i.e. series).
This operation is completed for all voxels, giving us as many lists of betas
as there are voxels in the data.
Essentially, we are given a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">4-D</span></code> dataset where the fourth dimension
represents trial number instead of time (as the fourth dimension is
represented in resting state).
And analogous to resting state data, we can perform correlations between the
voxels to discern which voxels (or which aggregation of voxels) synchronize
best with other voxels.</p>
<p>There is one final concept to cover in order to understand how the betas are
estimated in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">NiBetaSeries</span></code>.
You can model individual betas using a couple different strategies; with a
least squares all (LSA) approximation which the equation above represents,
and a least squares separate (LSS) approximation in which each trial is given
it’s own GLM.
The advantage of LSS comes from reducing the colinearity between closely spaced
trials.
In LSA, if trials occurred close in time then it would be difficult to model
whether the fluctuations should be attributed to one trial or the other.
LSS reduces this ambiguity by only having two regressors: one for the trial
of interest and another for every other trial.
This reduces the colinearity between regressors and makes each beta estimate
more reliable.</p>
